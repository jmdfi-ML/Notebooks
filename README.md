# Some ML project notebooks:

Client segmentation with clustering and visualisation
- With retail purchase dataset, created segmentation strategies based on unsupervised learning, mainly clustering: k-means, dbscan, optics

Computer vision project
- Using the Keras framework, classification of dog species with both full training and transfer learning strategies

Energy usage prediction

- Different strategies to predict electricity usage of Seattle buildings using ML algorithms, XGboost, decision trees, hyperparameters 

NLP classification project

- First, base approach to classify forum posts both supervised and unsupervised ML for sparse multitag classification, topic-modelling or embedding strategies
- Second approach using more recent transformer algorithms such as Bert-based models, XLnet for supervised ML
